# Time's Arrow: A Study of Entropy Through Particle Dynamics

This physics simulation explores one of the most fundamental questions in physics: why does time appear to flow in only one direction? Through simple particle dynamics, we can observe how energy dissipation and gravity contribute to time's apparent arrow.

## Scientific Purpose

This simulation helps visualize and study:
- The emergence of time's direction through entropy
- The role of energy dissipation (friction) and gravity in creating time asymmetry
- The apparent reversibility of physics in idealized (conservative) systems
- The breakdown of time symmetry when dissipative forces are introduced

## Key Physical Concepts

### Conservative vs Dissipative Systems

1. **Conservative System** (Friction & Gravity Disabled)
   - Energy is perfectly conserved
   - Collisions are elastic
   - Time reversibility is maintained
   - Forward and backward simulations are indistinguishable

2. **Dissipative System** (Friction &/or Gravity Enabled)
   - Energy dissipates through friction
   - Gravitational potential energy converts to kinetic energy
   - Time reversibility breaks down
   - Backward simulation shows physically implausible behavior (spontaneous energy gain)

### Visualization Features
- Particle color indicates kinetic energy (blue → white → red)
- Rotation indicators show angular momentum
- Real-time adjustment of physical parameters
- Time direction control for comparing forward/reverse behavior

## Running the Simulation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required packages: pygame, pymunk

### Installation
```bash
pip install pygame pymunk
python app.py
```

### Controls

**Physical Parameters:**
- `F`: Toggle friction (energy dissipation)
- `G`: Toggle gravity
- `I`: Toggle time direction (forward/backward)
- `SPACE`: Pause/Resume
- `R`: Reset simulation
- Mouse click: Add particles
- Up/Down arrows: Adjust time step

## Experimental Observations

Try these experiments to understand time's arrow:

1. **Conservative System Test**
   - Disable friction and gravity
   - Observe system behavior
   - Reverse time direction
   - Note: Forward and backward evolution should appear similar

2. **Dissipative System Test**
   - Enable friction and/or gravity
   - Observe system behavior
   - Reverse time direction
   - Note: Backward evolution shows unphysical behavior (spontaneous organization, energy gain)

3. **Mixed State Analysis**
   - Start with friction disabled
   - Allow system to reach steady state
   - Enable friction
   - Observe transition from reversible to irreversible behavior

## Technical Implementation

The simulation uses:
- Pymunk physics engine for particle dynamics
- State history tracking for time reversal
- Real-time energy calculations
- Elastic collision handling

## Limitations

- Simplified 2D model
- Discrete time steps
- Limited number of particles
- Idealized collision mechanics

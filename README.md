# 🏹 Time's Arrow: A Study of Entropy Through Particle Dynamics

This physics simulation explores one of the most fundamental questions in physics: why does time appear to flow in only one direction? Through simple particle dynamics, we can observe how energy dissipation and gravity contribute to time's apparent arrow.

## 🔬 Scientific Purpose

This simulation offers a modest exploration of:
- The emergence of time's direction through entropy increase (dS ≥ 0)
- The role of energy dissipation and gravity in creating time asymmetry
- The apparent reversibility of physics in idealized (conservative) systems
- The breakdown of time symmetry in dissipative systems

## 🎯 Key Physical Concepts

### Conservative vs Dissipative Systems

1. **Conservative System** (🚫 Friction & Gravity Disabled)
   - Energy is perfectly conserved: ΔE = 0
   - Collisions are elastic: p₁ + p₂ = p₁' + p₂'
   - Time reversibility is maintained: T̂H = HT̂
   - Phase space volume is preserved (Liouville's theorem)

2. **Dissipative System** (✨ Friction &/or Gravity Enabled)
   - Energy dissipates through friction: dE/dt ≤ 0
   - Gravitational potential energy converts to kinetic energy: ΔE = mgΔh
   - Entropy increases: ΔS > 0
   - Time reversibility breaks down

### 🎨 Visualization Features
- Particle color indicates kinetic energy (E = ½mv²)
- Angular momentum indicators (L = r × p)
- Real-time parameter adjustment
- Time direction control

## 🧪 Experimental Observations

Try these experiments to understand time's arrow:

1. **Conservative System Test** 🔄
   - Disable friction and gravity
   - Observe phase space conservation
   - Reverse time direction
   - Note: H(t) = H(-t) symmetry should be apparent

2. **Dissipative System Test** 📉
   - Enable friction and/or gravity
   - Watch entropy increase: dS/dt > 0
   - Reverse time direction
   - Note: Second law violation in reverse!

3. **Mixed State Analysis** 🔄📉
   - Start conservative (reversible)
   - Transition to dissipative
   - Observe emergence of time's arrow

*This simulation is a humble attempt to visualize some fundamental concepts about entropy and time's arrow. While greatly simplified, it may help build intuition about the relationship between energy dissipation and temporal asymmetry.*

**Key Equation:**
The Second Law of Thermodynamics, which underlies time's arrow:

$\frac{dS}{dt} \geq 0$

Where S is entropy, and equality holds only for reversible processes.
